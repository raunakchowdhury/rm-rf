PROJECT SUMMARY:
We will be simulating the final level of Plants vs Zombies 1. The conventional PvZ games allow you to expand your garden-army of plants with sun; however, in the Zomboss boss fight (the final boss), there is no sun. Our project is an emulation of the boss fight against Zomboss. The goal of the player is to strategically place his or her plants such that none of the zombies or their weapons come into contact with the house. However, there will be some changes made: the actual level will take place in the Garden setpiece (which is flat with grass), there will be no pots, and there will be no advanced phases (ie. the phase were the Zomboss AoE attacks some of your plants by throwing a van on top of them).
